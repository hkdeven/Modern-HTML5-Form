# A Modern Form for a Modern World

<img src="http://html5doctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/HTML5_Logo_256.png" align="right"/>

This is an open-sourced repo of an HTML5 form, built from scratch with it's own, bespoke grid system. This is a living projects so expect to see more updates to include cool validation and error handling and alerts.

If you're using an existing framework, such as bootstrap, you can simply strip this bespoke grid system in the `quote-form.css` file.  It was based on a 12 column grid like that of bootstrap so there shouldn't be much difference.

Because of the constraints of the project for which I am building this form, I have opted to use basic CSS over SASS.  But you can expect to see a SASS version in the near future.
